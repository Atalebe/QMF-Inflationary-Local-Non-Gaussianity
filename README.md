# Quantum Memory Field (QMF) — Simulation Repository

This repository contains the simulation code and derived outputs supporting the paper:

**“A Quantum Memory Field: Inflationary Local Non-Gaussianity and Non-Markovian Coherence Recovery”**

## Contents

- `inflation_bispectrum/`
  Scripts to evaluate the scaling of local-type non-Gaussianity  
  \( f_{NL}^{loc} \propto g(H/m_M)^2 \), including parameter scans and detectability plots.

- `spinboson_decoherence/`
  Spin–boson open-system simulations demonstrating two-timescale decoherence and echo-selective recovery.

- `neural_coherence_toy/`
  Minimal phase-oscillator toy model used to test internal consistency of coherence–integration dynamics
  (included for completeness; not used as empirical evidence).

- `outputs/`
  Figures and CSV tables used directly in the paper.

## Reproducibility

All figures can be regenerated by running the scripts in the corresponding directories using Python ≥ 3.10 with standard scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas).

No external or proprietary datasets are required.
